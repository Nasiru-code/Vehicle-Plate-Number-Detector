# Vehicle-Plate-Number-Detector made to enhance recognition of wrongly parked cars 
Open LPR is a distributed system aimed towards ease of management and high LPR throughput. The core consists of modules to perform the tasks of plate detection, classification and OCR.

Ground up the system is built to be scalable and can handle the load of a single site to a city wide area.

The entire stack is built on top of docker containers and is available in cpu only and gpu supported runtimes. Tensorflow, Keras and OpenCV are used amongst other libraries to deliver the service.
